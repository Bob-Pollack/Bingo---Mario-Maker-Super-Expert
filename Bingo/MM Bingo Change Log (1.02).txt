POSSIBLE FUTURE SQUARES

Can't Stop Won't Stop - Aside from the starting point and end goal, the level has no solid ground that mario can stand on. (not common)
Only avaialable in Mario Maker - The player takes advantage of a shellmet, spike helmet, or non-standard boot. (kinda iffy definition)
The Floor is Moving - The level makes frequent use of conveyor belts (kinda common but eh?)
Forced Crouch Jump - The player is forced to crouch jump into a small area to proceed (not sold on this being common at all)
Empty Shell Error - The player wears a helmet that needed to be thrown, or throws one that needed to be worn (player based)
